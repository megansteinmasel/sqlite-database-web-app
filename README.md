# SQLite Web App
## Overview
* The SQLite Web App is a full-stack application designed to interact with an SQLite database. It allows users to issue SQL queries, display various tables based on input, and perform several key database operations. This application provides a user-friendly interface for working with databases, supporting features like CRUD operations, searching, optimistic concurrency control, and paging.

## Features
* CRUD Operations: Perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the SQLite database.
* General and Advanced Search: Allow users to search the database with simple queries or more advanced filtering and sorting options.
* Optimistic Concurrency: Handle concurrent data access by implementing optimistic concurrency control to prevent data conflicts.
* Paging: Support paginated results to efficiently manage and display large datasets.
